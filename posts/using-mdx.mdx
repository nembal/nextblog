# MDX Support in NextBlog

This is a sample MDX file to demonstrate how NextBlog handles MDX content.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Example Component

Here's an example of how you might use a custom component in MDX:

```jsx
import { Alert } from './components/Alert'

<Alert type="info">
  This is an alert component in MDX!
</Alert>
```

## Code Blocks

MDX supports syntax highlighting for code blocks:

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting('MDX User'));
```

## Lists and Other Markdown Features

MDX supports all standard Markdown features:

- Bullet lists
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://mdxjs.com/)
